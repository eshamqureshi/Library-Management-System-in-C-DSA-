Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive application developed in C++ utilizing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The primary goal is to manage and manipulate data related to persons and books efficiently. The key DSA concepts implemented in this project include:

Double Linked List
Queue
Stack
File Handling
Features
Double Linked List:

Used to store and manage person data.
Allows efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of person records.
Queue:

Implements a queue to manage requests or processes in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.
Stack:

Uses stack structure for scenarios requiring last-in-first-out (LIFO) processing.
File Handling:

Two separate files are used:
perdata.txt for storing person data.
booksdata.txt for storing book data.
